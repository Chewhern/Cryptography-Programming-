This program shows how to generate RSA Key in random controlled environment or sequential controlled environment

This program also gives a small not obvious hint on how End to End encryption could be done easily using RSA

This program requires another big prime number list generator program that I will be uploading once it's finished.

Do not modify the code on master branch, modify the code on other available branch.

Any RSA key generation from 384 to 1024 was considered as the fastest

Any RSA key generation from 1280 to 2048 was considered as moderate

Any RSA key generation from 2304 to 3072 was considered as slow

Any RSA key generation from 3328 to 4096 was considered as the slowest

Any RSA key generation beyond 4096 will require multithreading/ background task to do
